title: Virtual Obeya Design Studio
subtitle: The Virtual Obeya Design Studio enables organizations to create a
  centralized digital hub ("Obeya") that aggregates and radiates critical
  information across teams. Its goal is to facilitate timely, fact-based
  decision-making, strategic alignment, and transparency in remote/hybrid work
  environments by visualizing strategy, work, performance, and cultural health.

whatIs: "**Obeya** (Japanese for \"Large Room\"):  \r

  - Originated from the Toyota Production System and Agile practices.  \r

  - Traditionally a physical space displaying charts, progress, and key
  metrics for visibility and accountability.  \r

  \r

  **Virtual Obeya**:  \r

  - A digital adaptation of the physical Obeya, designed for remote/hybrid
  teams.  \r

  - Acts as a central radiator of organizational information, supporting
  multiple perspectives (strategy, data, work, culture).  \r

  - Dynamically updates to reflect real-time business performance, cultural
  metrics, and strategic alignment.  "
whyDo: "**Key Signals for Implementation**:  \r

  - Decentralized or absent visualization of:  \r

  \  - Strategy decomposition.  \r

  \  - Cross-team work portfolios.  \r

  \  - Progress, flow efficiency, and performance metrics.  \r

  \  - Team health and social connections.  \r

  \r

  **Value Proposition**:  \r

  - Centralizes critical information (lead/lag indicators, cultural
  heuristics) for leaders and teams.  \r

  - Enables expedient, data-driven decisions and interventions.  \r

  - Promotes autonomy through directional alignment and transparency.  \r

  - Supports onboarding and continuous organizational learning.  "

  ### **Preparation**


  1. **Pre-Session Communication**:  

     * Share background materials asynchronously (e.g., "What is an Obeya?").  
     * Set clear expectations for synchronous/asynchronous contributions.  
  2. **Board Setup**:  

     * Prepare digital boards for each "MADO" (Strategy, Data, Work, Culture).  
     * Include facilitation notes, frameworks, and access instructions.  



  ### **Execution Framework**


  1. **Synchronous Sessions (120 mins max)**:  

     * Divide into four sections: **Strategy MADO**, **Data MADO**, **Work MADO**, **Culture MADO**.  
     * Timebox each section and prioritize high-value activities.  
  2. **Activity Flow for Each MADO**:  

     * **Capture Information Types**: Participants brainstorm required metrics (e.g., OKRs, risk dashboards).  
     * **Group & Vote**: Democratically prioritize top 5 needs through voting.  
     * **Validate & Assign Ownership**: Confirm data frequency, ownership, and tooling gaps.  
     * **Mitigate Risks**: Address confidentiality, integrity, and availability risks.  
  3. **Async Facilitation**:  

     * Pre-load data via surveys or existing tools to reduce session time.  
     * Document constraints and outcomes explicitly for team reference.  



  ### **Post-Session Actions**


  * **Track Actions**: Prioritize and complete decisions surfaced during sessions.  

  * **Update Group Memory**: Translate workshop outputs into the Virtual Obeya tool.  

  * **Schedule Reviews**: Regularly revisit the Obeya to adapt to organizational changes.  

  * **Onboard New Members**: Include a Virtual Obeya tour in onboarding processes.  




  ### **Key Considerations**


  * **Respect Fear**: Acknowledge potential intimidation and establish boundaries.  

  * **Tooling Gaps**: Identify and address missing tools during the "Tooling Gaps" activity.  

  * **Balance Sync/Async**: Tailor facilitation to team collaboration habits.
