title: Strategic Pre-Mortem
subtitle: The objective of a strategic pre-mortem is to proactively identify
  potential risks and failure points in a project or initiative *before* it
  begins. By simulating a future failure scenario, teams can uncover hidden
  challenges, mitigate risks early, and increase the likelihood of project
  success.

whatIs: A strategic pre-mortem is a collaborative exercise where participants
  imagine a project has already failed. Rooted in the work of Gary Klein, this
  practice encourages teams to work backward to diagnose hypothetical causes of
  failure. It leverages the expertise of stakeholders—including skeptics and
  domain experts—to surface concerns in a structured, non-confrontational
  environment. The exercise can be applied to projects of any scale, from large
  strategic initiatives to smaller tasks.
whyDo: "- **Learn from past failures**: Identify and address historical patterns
  of failure.  \r

  - **Engage experts**: Involve critical thinkers who might otherwise be
  overlooked.  \r

  - **Mitigate risks early**: Proactively resolve issues before they
  escalate.  \r

  - **Boost buy-in**: Foster ownership and alignment among stakeholders by
  addressing concerns upfront.  \r

  - **Save resources**: Avoid wasted effort by addressing potential pitfalls
  during planning.  "
howTo: "### Preparation  \r

  1. **Gather materials**: Collect project plans, lessons learned documents,
  purpose statements, and other relevant artifacts.  \r

  2. **Select participants**: Include leaders, key team members, and skeptics
  with domain expertise.  \r

  3. **Set expectations**: Communicate the session’s goal: *“Imagine this
  project failed—why did it happen?”*  \r

  \r

  ### Session Execution (60–90 minutes)  \r

  1. **Clarify the goal**:  \r

  \   - Have a stakeholder briefly articulate the project’s objective. Ensure
  alignment among participants.  \r

  \r

  2. **Review the plan**:  \r

  \   - Present the high-level project plan. Confirm shared understanding.  \r

  \r

  3. **Discuss past failures (optional)**:  \r

  \   - Ask participants to list similar past initiatives and their failure
  reasons. Capture insights.  \r

  \r

  4. **Simulate failure**:  \r

  \   - Instruct participants to write down hypothetical reasons for failure
  (e.g., “Poor communication” or “Resource shortages”).  \r

  \   - Share and group these reasons on a “What Went Wrong?” canvas.  \r

  \r

  5. **Prioritize risks**:  \r

  \   - Plot risks on a likelihood/consequence matrix. Focus on high-impact,
  high-probability risks.  \r

  \   - Discuss mitigations (e.g., “Assign a dedicated project manager” or
  “Secure budget approval upfront”).  \r

  \r

  6. **Assign actions**:  \r

  \   - Document actionable steps to address risks. Assign owners and
  deadlines.  \r

  \r

  ### Post-Session  \r

  - **Track actions**: Schedule follow-ups to ensure accountability.  \r

  - **Update documentation**: Transfer insights to team knowledge bases for
  future reference.  \r

  - **Onboard new members**: Use pre-mortem outputs to quickly align
  newcomers.  \r

  \r

  ### Async Facilitation Tips  \r

  - Use surveys or collaborative tools (e.g., shared docs) to gather input
  asynchronously.  \r

  - Balance async work with brief check-ins to maintain momentum.  \r

  - Document constraints and decisions clearly for remote participants.  "
