whatIs: "Group Planning is a flexible, rolling short-cycle process integrated
  into a team’s regular workflow. It replaces rigid long-term planning (e.g.,
  quarterly cycles) with iterative sessions focused on synchronizing team plans,
  surfacing risks and dependencies, and fostering alignment across the
  organization. Key components include:  \r

  - **Pre-planning**: Aligning teams with strategic roadmaps, OKRs, and known
  constraints.  \r

  - **Planning**: Developing team-specific roadmaps and backlogs based on
  organizational priorities.  \r

  - **Synchronization**: Collaboratively refining plans across teams to
  address complications and dependencies.  \r

  - **Post-planning**: Updating tools, resolving actions, and preparing for
  the next cycle."
whyDo: "- **Adapt to Change**: Traditional long-cycle plans often become invalid
  due to shifting priorities, market changes, or capacity issues. Group Planning
  ensures continuous alignment.  \r

  - **Improve Transparency**: Reduces surprises by surfacing risks and
  dependencies early, rather than during escalation meetings.  \r

  - **Enforce Accountability**: Creates a shared commitment to delivery
  through synchronized team plans and documented actions.  \r

  - **Optimize Capacity**: Identifies capability gaps and competing priorities
  to balance demand with realistic delivery capacity.  \r

  - **Foster Collaboration**: Breaks silos by requiring cross-team
  coordination to resolve complications (e.g., overlapping work,
  dependencies).  "

  ### **Pre-Planning Phase**


  1. **Socialize Strategic Inputs**: Share updated roadmaps, OKRs, and prioritized backlogs with all teams.  

  2. **Collect Constraints**: Document known Risks, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies, and Constraints (RAIDs), capacity limits, and unfinished work.  

  3. **Async Preparation**: Use asynchronous channels to clarify questions and ensure readiness.  




  ### **Planning Phase**


  1. **Develop Team Plans**:  

     * Build team roadmaps aligned with group OKRs.  
     * Prioritize backlogs (initiatives, compliance work, business-as-usual tasks).  
     * Map capacity impacts (e.g., holidays, skill gaps, budgets).  
  2. **Share Plans**: Socialize drafts with cross-portfolio and cross-organizational stakeholders for feedback.  




  ### **Synchronization Phase**


  1. **Collate Team Plans**: Aggregate plans into a **Group Plan Canvas** (Now, Next, Later sections).  

  2. **Playback & Refine**:  

     * Teams present plans, complications, and proposed actions (15 minutes per team).  
     * Stakeholders identify gaps, dependencies, and mitigation strategies (20 minutes per team).  
  3. **Document Actions**: Assign owners and timelines for resolving complications.  




  ### **Post-Planning Phase**


  1. **Update Systems**: Refresh backlogs, workflow tools, and RAIDs logs.  

  2. **Track Actions**: Ensure assigned actions are completed promptly.  

  3. **Reflect & Improve**: Conduct a retrospective to refine the process for future cycles.  




  ### **Key Tips**


  * **Timebox Sessions**: Limit synchronization meetings to 15–20 minutes per team.  

  * **Balance Async & Sync**: Use async prep to reduce meeting time but ensure live collaboration for critical decisions.  

  * **Respect Fear**: Acknowledge concerns about autonomy and provide leadership reassurance upfront.
