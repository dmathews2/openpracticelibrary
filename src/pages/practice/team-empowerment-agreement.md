title: Team Empowerment Agreement
subtitle: Empowerment Agreements are co-created understandings between
  managers/leaders and their teams that clarify decision-making boundaries,
  check-in points, and definitions of success. These agreements foster autonomy,
  mutual trust, and aligned accountability, enabling faster, more confident
  decision-making and reducing dependency bottlenecks.

  Empowerment Agreements are co-created understandings between managers/leaders
  and their teams that clarify decision-making boundaries, check-in points, and
  definitions of success. These agreements foster autonomy, mutual trust, and
  aligned accountability, enabling faster, more confident decision-making and
  reducing dependency bottlenecks

howTo: >-
  ### Step 1: **Set the Context**


  Explain the intent: to enable **clear, shared understanding** of empowerment — not restrict or control. This is about making collaboration smoother and freeing up energy for outcomes, not politics.


  > Example introduction:\

  > "Today we're going to define how we work together regarding decisions. Our goal is to ensure you have the clarity and freedom to act without hesitation while maintaining trust and alignment."


  ### Step 2: **Co-create the Empowerment Agreement**


  Facilitate a structured conversation with the team. Use three simple prompts:


  | Category                 | Guiding Questions                                       | Example Outputs                                                                                                   |

  | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

  | **Decide Independently** | "What decisions can you make without needing approval?" | \- Prioritizing daily work - Choosing technical tools (within security guidelines) - Adjusting sprint commitments |

  | **Check-in Points**      | "What decisions should we discuss or confirm together?" | \- Major resource allocation - Customer-facing policy changes - Exceeding budget limits                           |

  | **Success Measures**     | "How will we know our empowerment is working?"          | \- Increased speed of delivery - Higher team morale - Achievement of key OKRs                                     |


  ### Step 3: **Document the Agreement**


  Capture the collective agreements into a simple, clear document or visual format that everyone can access.\

  Keep it lightweight (1–2 pages maximum). Optionally, format it like a table for easy reference.


  ### Step 4: **Review and Adapt Regularly**


  Schedule regular touchpoints (e.g., quarterly) to review the Empowerment Agreement:


  * What’s working well?

  * Where do we need more clarity?

  * Where can we expand autonomy even further?


  Adjust as trust deepens and the team matures.




  ## Tips for Success


  * **Language matters**: Frame this as empowerment and growth, not as policing decisions.

  * **Leader modeling**: Leaders should genuinely **support and respect** the agreed autonomy.

  * **Evolving agreements**: Start with tighter check-ins if needed but relax them over time as confidence grows.

  * **Visual reminders**: Display empowerment maps or decision trees openly if helpful.
