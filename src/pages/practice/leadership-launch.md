whatIs: "A structured facilitation process designed to help leadership
  teams:  \r

  - **Align priorities** and clarify roles.  \r

  - **Delegate effectively** by refining decision-making frameworks.  \r

  - **Establish communication channels** to reduce redundant meetings.  \r

  - **Model desired behaviors** through intentional collaboration and
  vulnerability.  \r

  The practice combines synchronous workshops and asynchronous activities to
  create a \"living document\" that evolves with the team’s needs."
whyDo: "**Signals indicating the need:**  \r

  - Leadership fatigue or misalignment.  \r

  - Excessive time spent in meetings or operational tasks.  \r

  - Lack of transparency or communication between leaders.  \r

  - Organizational restructuring or shift to hybrid/remote work.  \r

  \r

  **Key benefits:**  \r

  - **Stronger alignment:** Creates shared understanding of roles and
  priorities.  \r

  - **Efficiency:** Reduces time spent in low-value activities through clear
  communication protocols.  \r

  - **Trust-building:** Encourages vulnerability and collaboration via
  exercises like *Story.Me* and SCARF model discussions.  \r

  - **Scalability:** Outputs serve as onboarding materials for new leaders and
  adapt to organizational changes.  "

  ### **Preparation**


  1. **Async Setup:**  

     * Prepare a digital board (e.g., Miro) with sections for activities like *Lifting Our Eyes* and *Decision Design*.  
     * Share pre-work (e.g., SCARF assessments, delegation policies) to streamline sessions.  
  2. **Team Briefing:**  

     * Communicate goals and pre-work requirements (15-minute recorded briefing).  



  ### **Key Activities**


  1. **Lifting Our Eyes** (90 mins live):  

     * Discuss time allocation across *Setting Direction*, *Building Systems*, *Improving Systems*, and *Stuck in Weeds*.  
     * Compare ideal vs. actual time distribution; identify actions to align priorities.  
  2. **Decision Design** (Async + Live Validation):  

     * Map decisions to four tiers: *Executive*, *Leader*, *Team*, *Individual*.  
     * Define support systems (e.g., frameworks, escalation policies).  
  3. **Measures** (Live):  

     * Agree on metrics for continuous improvement (customer, group, team).  
     * Stress-test metrics to avoid misuse.  
  4. **Collaboration & SCARF Model** (Live):  

     * Rank SCARF dimensions (Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, Fairness) to understand team motivations.  
  5. **Leadership Behaviors** (Live):  

     * Define team norms for *Vibe*, *Difficulty*, *Growth*, and *Support*.  
  6. **Communication Channels & Scheduling** (Live):  

     * Align on tools, response times, and emergency protocols.  
     * Schedule recurring events (e.g., strategy reviews) with clear ownership.  



  ### **Post-Workshop**


  * **Document & Share:** Convert outputs into a living document accessible via the team’s knowledge platform.  

  * **Track Actions:** Assign owners and deadlines for follow-up tasks.  

  * **Revisit:** Schedule quarterly reviews to update agreements and metrics.
