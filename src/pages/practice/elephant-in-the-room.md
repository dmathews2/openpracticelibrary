whatIs: The "Elephant in the Room" practice is a facilitated discussion
  technique designed to surface and address unspoken, uncomfortable, or
  sensitive issues that are impacting a group, team, or organization. These
  issues, often known to everyone but rarely discussed openly, can hinder
  progress, create tension, and damage trust. The "elephant" represents these
  unspoken truths, and the practice aims to bring them into the light for
  constructive dialogue.
whyDo: >-
  **Address Underlying Issues:** Unspoken problems fester and worsen over time.
  This practice allows for direct confrontation and resolution of these issues.


  **Improve Communication & Trust:** Openly discussing sensitive topics fosters a culture of transparency and builds trust among team members.


  **Enhance Collaboration & Productivity:** By clearing the air, teams can focus on their goals without the distraction of unresolved conflicts or concerns.


  **Promote Innovation & Creativity:** Addressing hidden issues can unlock new perspectives and ideas, leading to more innovative solutions.


  **Prevent Escalation:** Addressing issues early can prevent them from escalating into larger, more damaging problems.


  **Create a Safe Space:** To create a safe space where people feel they can express themselves without fear of reprisal.


  By implementing the "Elephant in the Room" practice, organizations can create a culture of openness, trust, and collaboration, leading to improved performance and innovation.

  **Preparation & Framing:**


  * Clearly define the purpose of the session. Emphasize that it's a safe space for open communication.

  * Set ground rules: confidentiality, respectful communication, and a focus on solutions.

  * Consider using a facilitator, especially for larger or more sensitive groups.


  **Identifying the "Elephant(s)":**


  * Start with a brief explanation of the "elephant in the room" metaphor.

  * Use open-ended questions to prompt discussion:

  * * "What unspoken issues are impacting our team/organization?"
    * "What are we avoiding talking about?"
    * "What concerns are we hesitant to voice?"
    * "What tensions do you feel?"
  * Allow for individual reflection and written contributions if needed.

  * Facilitate a brainstorming session to list potential "elephants."


  **Prioritizing & Selecting:**


  * If multiple "elephants" are identified, prioritize them based on impact and urgency.

  * Select one or two key "elephants" for focused discussion.


  **Facilitated Discussion:**


  * Create a structured discussion around the selected "elephant(s)."

  * Encourage participants to share their perspectives and experiences.

  * Focus on understanding the root causes of the issue.

  * Maintain a neutral and objective tone, avoiding blame or judgment.

  * Use active listening.

  * Allow everyone to speak.


  **Action Planning & Follow-Up:**


  * Brainstorm potential solutions or action steps to address the "elephant(s)."

  * Assign responsibilities and timelines for implementing the action steps.

  * Schedule follow-up meetings to track progress and ensure accountability.

  * Document the findings and action items.
