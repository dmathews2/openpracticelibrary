whatIs: "Group Launch Facilitation is a structured approach to forming and
  aligning teams at the \"group\" level (a team of teams). It combines
  synchronous and asynchronous facilitation methods to:  \r

  - Define the group’s context, relationships, and purpose.  \r

  - Design workflows, metrics, and decision-making frameworks.  \r

  - Establish behavioral agreements and communication channels.  \r

  - Streamline meetings and reduce coordination overhead.  \r

  \r

  The practice draws inspiration from adaptive leadership principles (e.g.,
  Gen. McChrystal’s \"gardener\" leadership model) and emphasizes clarity,
  autonomy, and alignment to combat organizational entropy. "
whyDo: "- **Reduce Organizational Chaos**: Prevents process bloat and
  misalignment by clarifying roles, workflows, and dependencies upfront.  \r

  - **Accelerate Onboarding**: Provides a clear reference for new members to
  understand the group’s purpose, structure, and norms.  \r

  - **Improve Collaboration**: Aligns teams on shared goals, reduces friction
  in handoffs, and fosters a culture of accountability.  \r

  - **Manage Complexity**: Addresses dependencies, risks, and external
  stakeholder relationships to ensure smooth workflow.  \r

  - **Enhance Adaptability**: Creates a foundation for continuous improvement
  and resilience against market or strategic shifts.  "

  ### Preparation


  1. **Gather Artifacts**: Collect stakeholder maps, strategy documents, value stream maps, RAID logs, and existing metrics.  

  2. **Assemble Participants**: Include leaders and key team members (small enough for efficiency, large enough for diverse input).  




  ### Execution Steps


  #### 1. Define Group Context


  * **Activities**:  

    * Map relationships (internal/external customers, stakeholders).  
    * Clarify strategic intent, unmet needs, and sources of demand.  
    * Identify dependencies and risks to workflow.  
    * Draft a purpose statement aligned with the group’s "edge" (specialization and differentiation).  
  * **Outcome**: A shared understanding of the group’s role in the broader organization.  




  #### 2. Design Group Workflow


  * **Activities**:  

    * Categorize work into *Planned*, *Unplanned*, and *Expedite*.  
    * Map stages for each category and test with historical work examples.  
    * Define success metrics (e.g., customer satisfaction, flow efficiency).  
    * Clarify decision authority (executive, leader, team, individual).  
  * **Outcome**: A unified workflow and measurable goals for the group.  




  #### 3. Establish Group Agreements


  * **Activities**:  

    * Co-create a social contract covering values, conflict resolution, and support expectations.  
    * Map team structures and handoffs to identify tensions.  
    * Build a backlog for continuous improvement (e.g., skill development, tooling).  
  * **Outcome**: A culture of accountability and mechanisms for resolving inter-team friction.  




  #### 4. Optimize Meetings


  * **Activities**:  

    * Audit existing meetings and eliminate redundancies.  
    * Design events for prioritization, planning, dependency management, and improvement.  
    * Assign ownership and frequency (e.g., weekly syncs, quarterly reviews).  
  * **Outcome**: A streamlined cadence that minimizes meetings while maximizing alignment.  




  ### Follow-Up


  * **Track Actions**: Assign and monitor completion of decisions surfaced during sessions.  

  * **Document Outcomes**: Translate outputs into the team’s knowledge management tools.  

  * **Iterate**: Revisit agreements and workflows periodically to adapt to changes.  


  By following this structured approach, groups can launch effectively, sustain alignment, and deliver value consistently.
