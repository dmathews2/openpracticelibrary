whatIs: The World Café is a structured conversational process that simulates the
  relaxed, creative, and engaging atmosphere of a café. Participants are seated
  in small groups at tables to discuss a specific, powerful question. After set
  "rounds" of conversation, participants move to different tables, mixing with
  new people. This movement acts as a cross-pollination mechanism, allowing
  ideas and insights to travel and connect throughout the entire group, leading
  to a deeper, collective discovery.
whyDo: >-
  This practice is chosen over traditional meetings or presentations for several
  key reasons:


  * **Fosters Deep Collaboration:** It breaks down hierarchies and silos, encouraging authentic dialogue among people who might not normally interact.

  * **Surfaces Collective Wisdom:** It is based on the principle that the knowledge and answers a group seeks are already present within its members. The Café provides a method to surface this collective wisdom.

  * **Encourages Diverse Perspectives:** The rotation of participants ensures that ideas are examined from multiple viewpoints, leading to more robust and innovative solutions.

  * **Creates Shared Ownership:** By participating directly in the creation of ideas and solutions, individuals feel a greater sense of ownership and are more likely to be committed to follow-up actions.

  * **Addresses Complex Challenges:** It is particularly effective for exploring complex, adaptive challenges that do not have a single, simple answer.

  Executing a World Café involves a few key steps and roles.


  **Preparation Phase:**


  1. **Create a Hospitable Space:** Arrange the room with several small tables (for 4-5 people each) to feel like a café. Cover tables with paper "tablecloths" and provide plenty of colorful markers for doodling and writing down ideas.

  2. **Define Powerful Questions:** The success of a World Café depends on the quality of its questions. They should be open-ended, relevant to the group, and thought-provoking. You can use one question for all rounds or a series of questions that build on each other.


  **Execution Phase:** 


  3. **Welcome and Introduction:** The facilitator welcomes participants, explains the purpose of the session, the process (including the rotations), and the "Café Etiquette" (e.g., focus on what matters, contribute your thinking, listen to understand, connect diverse perspectives). 


  4. **Round 1 (20-30 minutes):** Participants at each table discuss the first powerful question. They are encouraged to write, draw, and connect ideas on their paper tablecloths. 


  5. **The Rotation:** At the end of the round, one person is asked to remain at the table as the "Table Host." All other participants ("Travelers") move to a different table. 


  6. **Round 2 & 3 (20-30 minutes each):** 


  \* The Table Host welcomes the new arrivals and briefly shares the essence of the previous conversation. 


  \* The Travelers share key insights from their former tables. 


  \* The group then continues the conversation, building on the layered ideas. This cycle is typically repeated for 2-3 rounds.


  **Harvesting Phase:** 


  7. **Collective Harvest (30-45 minutes):** After the final round, the entire group comes together to "harvest" the collective discoveries. A facilitator asks the group to share patterns, themes, key insights, and deeper questions that emerged from their conversations. These are captured on a flip chart or whiteboard for everyone to see, creating a visual map of the group's collective intelligence.
