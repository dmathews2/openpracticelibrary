whatIs: Idea Cyclone is a high-energy, facilitator-led brainstorming
  methodology. It moves participants through three distinct, progressively
  challenging rounds of idea generation. Unlike traditional brainstorming, it
  emphasizes a rapid, out-loud, collaborative process within small teams, where
  ideas are immediately shared to inspire others. The dynamic is designed to
  create a "cyclone" of creativity, starting broad and gradually uncovering more
  unique and disruptive solutions.
whyDo: >-
  **Overcome Creative Blocks:** The fast pace and multi-round structure force
  participants to exhaust their "go-to" ideas quickly, making way for more
  innovative thinking.


  **Maximize Quantity for Quality:** It operates on the principle that a large quantity of ideas is the best source for a few high-quality, breakthrough concepts.


  **Enhance Collaboration:** The "out-loud" generation process ensures that team members are actively listening and building upon each other's contributions in real-time, fostering a highly synergistic environment.


  **Produce Actionable Outcomes:** It doesn't just end with a wall of sticky notes. The built-in dot-voting phase creates a clear, prioritized list of winning ideas and a categorized backlog for future reference.

  **Phase 0: Setup & Ground Rules (5 min)**


  1. **Form Teams:** Divide participants into small teams of 4-5 people.

  2. **Explain the Challenge:** Clearly state the problem or topic for the ideation session.

  3. **Set the Ground Rules:** The facilitator communicates the core principles:

     * **No Bad Ideas:** Defer judgment. The goal is volume.
     * **Build on Others' Ideas:** Actively listen and use others' thoughts as a launchpad. This is the most critical rule.
     * **Be Brief:** One idea per sticky note. A short phrase is enough.
     * **Encourage Disruption:** Don't be afraid to challenge assumptions.

  **Phase 1: The Initial Burst (15-20 min)**


  1. **Collective Out-Loud Generation (5-7 min):** Within each team, participants start calling out ideas. There's no set order. As ideas are spoken, a designated scribe (or each person) writes them on sticky notes. The goal is to create an energetic conversation, aiming for a team total equivalent to 8-10 ideas per person.

  2. **Post on the Board:** Teams post their sticky notes on a designated section of the main board.

  3. **Share & Group:** A spokesperson from each team briefly presents key themes that emerged.


  **Phase 2: The Deepening Wave (15-20 min)**


  1. **The New Challenge:** The facilitator instructs the teams: "Now, generate a new wave of ideas. The challenge is they must be completely new concepts, not variations of what's already on the board."

  2. **Collective Out-Loud Generation (5-7 min):** The process repeats. Teams aim to generate the equivalent of 4-5 *new* ideas per person.

  3. **Post and Share:** New sticky notes (ideally a different color) are added to the board.


  **Phase 3: The Unexpected Twist (15-20 min)**


  1. **The Final Challenge:** The facilitator gives the final prompt: "For this last round, let's push the boundaries. Think of ideas that break a current rule or assumption of our project. What becomes possible if we remove a key constraint (like budget, time, or a specific technology)?"

  2. **Collective Out-Loud Generation (5 min):** Teams have a final, focused conversation to generate 2-3 of these disruptive ideas per person.

  3. **Post and Share:** The final ideas are added to the board.


  **Phase 4: Convergence & Prioritization (15 min)**


  1. **Thematic Grouping:** The facilitator, with help from the teams, groups similar ideas from all rounds into thematic clusters.

  2. **Dot Voting:** Each participant receives 3 to 5 dot stickers. They walk up to the board and place their dots on the ideas they believe have the most potential.

  3. **Identify Winners:** The ideas with the most dots are identified as the "Winning Ideas."
