  A structured framework to **design, analyze, and improve interactions** between teams. It focuses on:  


  * **Bridging silos** by clarifying dependencies and shared purposes.  

  * **Streamlining workflows** to reduce bottlenecks (e.g., hidden queues, misaligned priorities).  

  * **Creating actionable agreements** for smoother collaboration.  


  **Applicable when:**  


  * Launching new teams/groups.  

  * Addressing recurring conflicts or dependency delays.  

  * Conducting retrospectives identifying interaction issues.  

  * Refreshing operational cadences (e.g., every 6 months).
whyDo: "- **Accelerate Delivery**: 60‚Äì80% of delays occur *between* teams due to
  unclear handoffs.  \r

  - **Reduce Friction**: Proactively address misunderstandings before they
  escalate.  \r

  - **Enhance Customer Value**: Align interactions to directly support
  customer/organizational outcomes.  \r

  - **Future-Proof Teams**: Codify agreements for onboarding and scaling.  "

  ### üõ†Ô∏è Preparation


  1. **Gather Context**:  

     * Collect artifacts: Team Launch Canvases, Group Plans, Team APIs, or existing agreements.  
  2. **Select Participants**:  

     * 1‚Äì3 representatives per team (leaders or domain experts).  



  ### üéØ Execution


  #### **Step 1: Live Facilitation (90 mins)**


  1. **Define Collective Purpose (30 mins)**  

     * Draft a purpose statement:\
       *"We interact when \[trigger] to \[action] so that \[benefit]."*  
     * Example:\
       *"Teams interact when a new feature is deployed to validate compliance so security risks are mitigated."*  



  1. **Reflect on Interactions (30 mins)**  

     * Use Norm Kerth‚Äôs **Prime Directive**:\
       *"Assume everyone did their best given their context."*  
     * Retrospective structure:  

       * ‚úÖ **What works** (e.g., clear escalation paths).  
       * ‚ùå **What doesn‚Äôt** (e.g., delayed approvals).  
       * ‚ö†Ô∏è **Future risks** if unaddressed.  



  1. **Design Team Interfaces (30 mins)**  

     * Brainstorm solutions:  

       * **Eliminate**: Automate handoffs, create self-service tools.  
       * **Simplify**: Improve communication channels (e.g., shared dashboards).  
       * **Optimize**: Align meeting cadences, limit work-in-progress.  
     * Vote on top 3 actions and assign owners.  



  #### **Step 2: Async Facilitation (Optional)**


  * Use surveys or docs to:  

    * **Pre-capture data** (e.g., pain points).  
    * **Document constraints** (e.g., budget limits).  
  * Set timeboxes to avoid over-analysis.  




  ### üîÑ Follow-Up


  1. **Track Actions**: Use a visible tracker (e.g., Kanban) and prioritize quick wins.  

  2. **Update Knowledge Base**: Convert agreements into onboarding docs or team wikis.  

  3. **Schedule Reflections**: Revisit agreements quarterly or after major team changes.

  **Outcome**: Teams with clear, customer-aligned workflows and measurable reductions in cross-team friction.
