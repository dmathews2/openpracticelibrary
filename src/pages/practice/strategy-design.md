  Design an adaptive strategy that articulates your core beliefs, maps your
  competitive ecosystem, defines your unique position, and creates a dynamic
  execution rhythm to thrive in changing markets.


  **Strategy Design is your playbook for turning chaos into clarity!** It combines:  


  * 🧠 **Soul-Searching** (What do we stand for?)  

  * 🗺️ **Ecosystem Cartography** (Mapping the "Corporate Forest" of competitors, disruptors, and resources)  

  * 🎯 **Position Crafting** (Finding your unique spot in the jungle)  

  * 🔄 **Adaptive Rhythm** (Building a strategy heartbeat that keeps pace with change)

  |---------|---------|  \r

  | ✨ **Purpose Power** | Stop drifting! Define your legacy and rally your
  team. |  \r

  | 🧭 **Competitive Clarity** | See hidden threats/opportunities (like
  spotting 🐯 in the forest!). |  \r

  | 🚀 **Dynamic Adaptation** | Pivot faster than startups and outmaneuver
  giants. |  \r

  | 🔋 **Energy Alignment** | Stop fighting momentum—*ride* your
  organization’s natural enthusiasm. |  "
howTo: "### ❓ Key Questions\r

  \r

  - 🌍 What community impact do we create?\r

  - 📈 What development opportunities do we provide?\r

  - 🔓 What autonomy do we enable?\r

  - ✨ What positive influence do we have?\r

  ## 🗺️ Map Ecosystem\r

  \r

  **Purpose:** Understand competitive landscape and identify strategic
  opportunities.\r

  \r

  ### 📋 Preparation\r

  \r

  - 🔍 **Prepare:** Collect competitor analysis, market research, customer
  journey maps, and industry trend reports \r

  - 🗺️ Map current ecosystem using the Corporate Forest metaphor \r

  - 📊 Identify landscape characteristics and competitive positioning \r

  - 🔄 Analyse movement patterns and emerging opportunities\r

  \r

  **🎯 Outcomes:** Comprehensive ecosystem map and competitive positioning
  analysis.\r

  \r

  ### 🌲 The Corporate Forest\r

  \r

  Apply the Corporate Forest metaphor to understand your competitive landscape
  through multiple interconnected layers. Add or extend the metaphor as
  needed:\r

  \r

  #### 🏢 Companies\r

  - 🌳 **Giant Oak:** Dominant incumbent (Amazon, Microsoft, Woolworths)\r

  - 🌲 **Fast Redwood:** Rising challenger (Tesla, TikTok, Shopify)\r

  - 🍁 **Maple Tree:** Adaptable player that changes strategies seasonally\r

  - 🌸 **Dogwood:** Specialised niche player with premium offerings\r

  - 🌻 **Wildflowers:** Fast-growing startups (most die, few survive)\r

  - 🌿 **Ferns:** Service providers/consultants\r

  \r

  #### 🤝 Relationship\r

  - 🐝 **Bees:** Loyal customers who pollinate/spread word\r

  - 🐦 **Birds:** Big customers who can carry you to new markets\r

  - 🍄 **Mushrooms:** Investors/VCs (feed on dead companies, help new
  growth)\r

  \r

  #### ⚡ Disruptors\r

  - 🌿 **Invasive Kudzu:** Disruptors that change everything\r

  - 🔥 **Fire:** Economic crashes/major disruptions\r

  - 🌴 **Strangler Fig:** Platform businesses (starts small, eventually
  dominates)\r

  \r

  #### 🌱 Resources\r

  - ☀️ **Revenue (Sunlight):** Customer attention/market share\r

  - 🌧️ **Market Awareness (Rainfall):** Brand visibility distribution\r

  - 🌱 **Soil Quality:** Talent, capital, strategic assets\r

  \r

  ### 🤔 Hypothesise your position\r

  - 📍 Where are you in the forest? (e.g. Giant Oak, Fern etc)\r

  - 🔧 What leverage do you have access to?\r

  - 📦 What resources do you need?

  \r

  ## 🎯 Refine Position\r

  \r

  **Purpose:** Define where in the competitive landscape the organisation will
  play and determine the strategic capabilities required for success.\r

  \r

  ### 📋 Preparation\r

  **Purpose:** Define where in the competitive landscape you will play.\r

  \r

  **🎯 Outcomes:** Identify and validate strategic opportunities based on your
  positioning.\r

  \r

  ### 🧪 Strategic Position Testing Framework\r

  \r

  Before committing to a strategic position, stress-test your position using
  at least three of the options below:\r

  \r

  #### 🔄 Work Backwards - Reverse Engineering Success\r

  Start with desired outcome, trace prerequisites and milestones needed to
  achieve it\r

  - **Netflix 2007:** \"Own content creation by 2020\" → invest in data
  analytics → understand viewing patterns → fund original series\r

  - **Tesla:** \"Mass market EVs by 2025\" → build battery gigafactory →
  develop Model 3 → prove luxury market first with Model S\r

  \r

  **🚀 Application:** Define your 5-year strategic aim, then map the specific
  capabilities, partnerships, and milestones required\r

  \r

  #### 🔀 Role Reversal - Flipping Stakeholder Relationships\r

  Challenge traditional roles to uncover new business model possibilities\r

  - **Customer-Supplier Flip:** \"What if our customers were our suppliers?\"
  → Airbnb (guests become hosts), YouTube (viewers become creators)\r

  - **Competitor-Partner Flip:** \"What if our competitors were our
  partners?\" → Apple Pay (banks become distribution channels), Spotify (labels
  become content partners)\r

  \r

  **🚀 Application:** Map your key stakeholders and explore what happens when
  you reverse each relationship.\r

  \r

  #### 🌐 Industry Borrowing - Cross-Pollination Strategy\r

  Apply successful patterns from unrelated domains to your sector\r

  - **Banking adopts Gaming:** Gamification, levels, achievements, progress
  bars for financial goals\r

  - **Healthcare adopts Hospitality:** Ritz-Carlton patient experience
  protocols, concierge medicine models\r

  \r

  **🚀 Application:** Identify 3 industries you admire and explore how their
  core strategies could transform your approach\r

  \r

  #### 🎯 Have-It-All Strategy - Eliminating False Trade-offs\r

  Search for positions that deliver multiple benefits simultaneously rather
  than forcing trade-offs\r

  - **Amazon:** Low prices AND fast delivery AND wide selection (platform
  economics avoid usual retail trade-offs)\r

  - **Patagonia:** Premium pricing AND environmental mission AND customer
  loyalty (values alignment eliminates price sensitivity)\r

  \r

  **🚀 Application:** List your assumed trade-offs and challenge each one -
  what would make them false choices?\r

  \r

  #### 📏 Boundary Questions - Organisational Scope Challenge\r

  Challenge what your organisation includes, excludes, and why\r

  - \"Why do we manufacture when we could orchestrate?\" → Nike
  (design/marketing), Uber (mobility without cars)\r

  - \"Why do we serve this customer segment but not that one?\" → Stripe
  (developers first, then enterprises), Tesla (luxury first, then mass market)\r

  \r

  **🚀 Application:** Question every aspect of your current business model -
  what if you did the opposite?\r

  \r

  #### 👀 Attention Audit - Leadership Focus Reality Check\r

  Track where leadership focus actually goes versus stated strategic
  priorities\r

  - **CEO Calendar Mismatch:** 60% internal meetings, 40% customer/market →
  strategic priority claims \"customer-first\"\r

  - **Board Meeting Disconnect:** 80% financial review, 20% future growth →
  strategic goal is \"digital transformation\"\r

  \r

  **🚀 Application:** Audit leadership calendars, meeting agendas, and
  resource allocation against strategic priorities\r

  \r

  #### ⚡ Energy Mapping - Following Organisational Momentum\r

  Follow where organisational enthusiasm naturally flows to find strategic
  momentum\r

  - **Engineer Enthusiasm:** Team gravitates toward AI projects → pivot from
  consulting to AI-powered products\r

  - **Sales Energy:** Team excited about international prospects → geographic
  expansion becomes growth vector\r

  \r

  **🚀 Application:** Map where your organisation's energy naturally flows and
  align strategy with momentum\r

  \r

  #### 🚫 Obviously Bad Ideas - Competitive Avoidance Analysis\r

  Catalogue what competitors do that you deliberately avoid and examine why\r

  - **Southwest Airlines:** \"We don't do assigned seating, meal service, or
  hub-and-spoke routing\"\r

  - **Tesla:** \"We don't do dealers, advertising, or annual model
  refreshes\"\r

  \r

  **🚀 Application:** List what you deliberately don't do and explore whether
  these \"bad ideas\" could become strategic advantages\r

  \r

  #### 🔄 Strategic Archetype Flip - Fundamental Stance Change\r

  Fundamentally change your organisational stance and competitive approach\r

  - **From Defender to Prospector:** IBM (mainframes → cloud services), Disney
  (theme parks → streaming platforms)\r

  - **From Analyser to Prospector:** Microsoft (software licensing →
  cloud-first innovation), Amazon (books → everything platform)\r

  \r

  **🚀 Application:** Identify your current strategic archetype and explore
  what a fundamental flip would enable\r

  \r

  ### ✅ Validate Intent\r

  \r

  Testing your position in the corporate forest will define the constraints
  and opportunities to succeed, or highlight the assumptions that require
  further validation. Then define what needs to be communicated.\r

  \r

  #### 🧭 Strategic Direction:\r

  - 🤔 Why is this the strategy?\r

  - 📍 What is the direction and plan?\r

  \r

  #### 🚧 Boundary Conditions:\r

  - ⚖️ What is necessary to maintain coherent progress within the company?\r

  - 🛡️ What do we refuse to lose in order to achieve the strategy?\r

  \r

  ### 🧪 Assumption Testing\r

  \r

  Establish a catalogue of assumptions, aggressively test them to sharpen your
  strategy.\r

  \r

  **📝 Template:** \"If [specific action], then [measurable outcome] will
  occur, because [underlying belief].\"\r

  \r

  **📚 Examples:**\r

  - \"If we launch freemium, then we'll acquire 1,000 users in 90 days,
  because 73% show price sensitivity.\"\r

  - \"If we partner with distributors, then we'll reduce acquisition costs by
  40%, because direct sales requires unaffordable field teams.\"\r
